                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
                    language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a
                    host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript
                    can be connected to the objects of its environment to
                    provide programmatic control over them.

                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as
                    Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements
                    such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core
                    JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
                    supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
                <p>
                    <ul><li> Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by
                            supplying objects to control a browser and its
                            Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                            client-side extensions allow an application to place
                            elements on an HTML form and respond to user events
                            such as mouse clicks, form input, and page
                            navigation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by
                            supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on
                            a server. For example, server-side extensions allow
                            an application to communicate with a database,
                            provide continuity of information from one
                            invocation to another of the application, or perform
                            file manipulations on a server.

                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but
                    fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                    language resembles Java but does not have Java's static
                    typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
                    Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
                    control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
                    renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.

                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built
                    by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based
                    on a small number of data types representing numeric,
                    Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based
                    object model instead of the more common class-based object
                    model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                    inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for
                    individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions
                    without any special declarative requirements. Functions can
                    be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
                    methods.
                </p>
                <code>
                    var n = 0;
                </code>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java.
                    You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and
                    methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether
                    methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not
                    have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
                    function return types are not explicitly typed.

                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:
                    With the keyword var. For example,</p>
                <code>
                    const [a,b] = [...t]
                </code>
                <p>
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global
                    variables.

                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                </p>
                <code>
                    const a = 562;
                    let s = "trivial";
                </code>
